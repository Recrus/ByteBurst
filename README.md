# Byte-Burst Landing Page Showcase

Welcome to my landing page project! This project is a testament to my skills in HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. It's a simple, yet elegant, demonstration of what I can craft using only these technologies.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The landing page is optimized for all screen sizes.
- **Clean SCSS:** I've structured the SCSS to be modular and easy to maintain.
- **Interactive Elements:** Using vanilla JavaScript, the landing page has some interactive elements to keep users engaged.
